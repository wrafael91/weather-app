# Weather-App
This is a weather application based on OpenWeatherNow API services (https://openweathermap.org/). 
It's a static page in which renders weather forecast data for two specific locations: Bogotá, COL, and France (Lyon, Paris).
Front-end code is supported in HTML and CSS. Back-end code was typed in JavaScript. 
The way to fetch data info from the API server is XMLHTTPrequest. The application is responsive on tablets and cellphones.
The weather-app site has been temporarily deployed at https://wrafael91.github.io (GitHub pages).

Thanks.
