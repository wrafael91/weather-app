# Weather-App
This is a weather application based on OpenWeatherNow API services (https://openweathermap.org/). 
It's a static page in which renders weather forecast data for two specific locations: Bogot√°, COL, and France (Lyon, Paris).
Front-end code is supported in HTML and CSS. Back-end code was typed in JavaScript. 
The way to fetch data info from the API server is XMLHTTPrequest. The application is responsive on tablets and cellphones.
We are working to have it deployed online right now.

Thanks.
